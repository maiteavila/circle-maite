        <h2>What is a Like Button?</h2>
        <p>The "like" button operates as a straightforward digital mechanism that transforms user interest into a single, quantifiable action. Usually represented by a small icon in the shape of a thumbs-up or a heart, the like button’s placement is strategic— designed to invite interaction from the user. The icon immediately changes appearance when engaged with, signaling to the user that the action of “liking” has been completed.</p>
